The primary mechanism of edema in HSE is cellular retention of sodium. The infection triggers the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, which stimulate astrocytes to release sodium. This leads to cellular edema, which is the primary cause of the increased intracranial pressure seen in HSE. The other options are incorrect because they describe mechanisms of ed",
